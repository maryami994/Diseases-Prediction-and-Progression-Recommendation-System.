# Diseases-Prediction-and-Progression-Recommendation-System.
This project aims to develop a machine learning system that detects and tracks the 
progression of five specific diseases—diabetes, heart disease, anemia, liver 
disease, and kidney disease—based on patient health records. 
The project consists of two key phases: 
1. Disease Prediction: 
○ Multiple classification models will be trained to determine whether a 
patient has any of the five diseases based on health indicators. 
○ The system will analyze patient data and output a list of detected 
diseases, if any. 
2. Disease Progression Forecasting: 
○ For each predicted disease, a separate progression model will estimate 
how the condition may evolve. 
○ Disease-specific data will provide insights into potential deterioration or 
stability, assisting in early intervention and treatment planning. 
By combining disease detection and progression analysis, this system will 
support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, prioritizing 
diagnoses, and developing personalized treatment plans.
